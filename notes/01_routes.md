Suppose your routes are:

js
{
  path : "",
  element : <Home />
},
{
  path: ":explore",
  element : <ExplorePage />
},
{
  path: ":explore/:id",
  element : <DetailsPage />
}
/ matches the home page.

/movies will match the ExplorePage, and explore will be 'movies'.

/tvshows/123 will match the DetailsPage, with explore = 'tvshows' and id = '123'.

Why Use This?
You use colons to capture dynamic parts of the URL so you can use them in your page/component.

For example, in DetailsPage, you could read useParams() to get {explore: 'movies', id: '123'}.

In summary:
Colon = "this is a variable part of the path"

No colon = fixed/static path

Example usage in component:import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

function DetailsPage() {
  const { explore, id } = useParams();
  // You can now use explore and id in your component
}
If you have further questions about dynamic routes or React Router, feel free to ask!



## The class active:scale-50 is a Tailwind CSS utility that applies a transformation scale of 0.5 (half size) to an element when it is in the :active state. The active state usually corresponds to when you are clicking or tapping an element (for example, when you click and hold a button).

What does it do?
scale-50: Shrinks (scales) the element to 50% of its original size.

active:: Means this scaling only happens when the element is active (i.e., being pressed/clicked).

Example
jsx
<button className="active:scale-50 transition">

## is setting an inline CSS style for the element, specifically the transform CSS property. Here's what it does:

What does transform: translateX() do?
Moves (translates) an element horizontally on the X-axis.

The value is usually in pixels (px) or percentages (%).

translateX(100%) moves the element one full width of itself to the right.

translateX(-100%) moves it one full width to the left.

translateX(0%) is the original position.

What is ${currentImage * 100}%?
Suppose currentImage is 0: result is translateX(0%) — no move.

If currentImage is 1: result is translateX(100%) — one full width to the right.

If currentImage is -1: result is translateX(-100%) — one full width to the left.

If currentImage is 2: result is translateX(200%) — two widths to the right.

Where is this used?
Image sliders/carousels:
In a carousel, you often have a "track" of images that you translate to bring the desired image into view.

As you change currentImage (with next/prev buttons), the whole track shifts left or right.

Example:
If you have

js
<div style={{transform: `translateX(${currentImage * -100}%)`}}>
  {/* All your images inside here */}
</div>
and there are several images side-by-side in a row, when currentImage is 1, the track moves left by 100%, showing the second image in view.

Note: A negative value (-100%) normally moves the carousel to the left (which is what you typically want for most carousels/sliders).

## 1. Routing in React (who sees what page?)
In single page apps like React, you define routes—URL patterns that show different components. For example, / shows Home, /movie shows the Movie listing, etc.

2. Your Router Configuration
Your configuration:

js
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "",
    element: <App />,   // <--- Your top-level 'shell'
    children: [
      {
        path: "",
        element: <Home />
      },
      {
        path: ":explore",
        element: <ExplorePage />
      },
      {
        path: ":explore/:id",
        element: <DetailsPage />
      },
      {
        path: "search",
        element: <SearchPage />
      }
    ]
  }
])
What are these path values?
"" (empty string): this is the root path, meaning /—the homepage.

:explore: the : means "this part is a variable." So this matches anything after the slash, like /tv or /movie.

:explore/:id: matches a URL like /tv/123 or /movie/456.

"search": matches /search.

3. What happens when you click "TV Shows"?
Suppose your "TV Shows" menu link points to /tv.

When you click it, the browser URL changes to /tv.

React Router looks through your configuration for a match.

Looking at your router:
It finds path: ":explore" under children (since :explore is a variable).

:explore matches tv in the URL /tv.

So it will render your <ExplorePage /> component!

If you click "Movies" and the link points to /movie, :explore matches to "movie" and <ExplorePage /> is shown again (likely with different content because your ExplorePage reads the param).

4. How does it know if you want TV or Movies?
Inside your ExplorePage component, you can use React Router's useParams() hook. For example:

js
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function ExplorePage() {
  const { explore } = useParams(); // explore will be "tv" or "movie"
  // Now use explore to fetch/show the right list!
}
5. What About /tv/123 or /movie/456?
If you visit /tv/123, React Router looks at path: ':explore/:id'.

Here, :explore is tv and :id is 123. So it renders <DetailsPage /> (for, say, a show or movie detail).

6. Visual Summary
Example Path	Route Matches	Component Rendered	Params
/	""	<Home />	n/a
/tv	:explore	<ExplorePage />	explore = "tv"
/movie	:explore	<ExplorePage />	explore = "movie"
/tv/123	:explore/:id	<DetailsPage />	explore = "tv", id = 123
/search	search	<SearchPage />	n/a
7. Why Colons (:)?
Colons define a variable (“param”) route segment. That lets you use the same component for different content (like TV and movies) without writing a new route for each case.

8. In Summary
:explore acts like a “wildcard” for any path in that slot (e.g., /tv, /movie).

Clicking "TV Shows" (to /tv) matches :explore, so <ExplorePage /> gets shown.

The actual value (e.g., "tv" or "movie") is available in your component using useParams().

The structure is flexible—you can add more content types by adding menu links to new URLs (like “/documentary”, “/anime”, etc.), and ExplorePage can handle them all.

If you want to differentiate what’s shown for TV vs Movies, update your ExplorePage to look at explore from useParams(), and display the right content based on its value.
